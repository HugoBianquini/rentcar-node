-- Use an EC2 instance on AWS

- Configure SSH
- Create "app" user and grant it sudo permissions
- Create `.ssh` folder under app user
- Create `authorized_keys` file and put your ssh public key on it
- Run "sudo apt update"
- Install Node via apt
- Install docker via apt
- Grant docker permission to your user (check running docker ps)
- Install yarn using npm


-- Configure your application 

- create build script on package.json using babel
- add .env on gitignore (the env will be rewritten for prod environment)
- add ormconfig.json on gitignote (it will be replaced by the prod database)


-- Prepare application on EC2

- create a ssh key and put it into github
- clone your repository
- run docker-compose -d database to run just your database in a container
- run your application through dist folder "node ./dist/shared/infra/http/server.js"

OBS: build the application using babel to convert typescript to javascript. This makes the deploy on the VM easier
